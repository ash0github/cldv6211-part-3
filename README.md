Please note that this application allows you to create an account as a merchant, or a consumer, providing functionality for both roles!

Consumers are able to view all registered products on the database, meanwhile merchants are only able to view the products that they create, or post up for sale.
You can not change your role once you select it after registering a new account.

Please feel free to create your own account or use the ones that I created for testing purposes.

Merchant: merchant@kmc.com

Consumer: consumer@kmc.com

Password: Test@1234

N.B. The source code includes functionalitiies for Azure AI Search, as well as Durable Functions. Please be mindful of such.
